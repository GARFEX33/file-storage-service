# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement POST /upload Endpoint
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Create an endpoint to upload files and their metadata.
# Details:
Use Multer middleware to handle file uploads. Implement the POST /upload route to save the file to the specified UPLOADS_PATH and store metadata in the database. Validate file type and size, and ensure filename uniqueness.

# Test Strategy:
Test file uploads with various file types and sizes. Verify that duplicate filenames are rejected and metadata is correctly stored in the database.
