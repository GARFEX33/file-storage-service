# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement DELETE /files/:id Endpoint
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create an endpoint to delete a file and its metadata by ID.
# Details:
Implement the DELETE /files/:id route to remove the file from the UPLOADS_PATH and delete its metadata from the database. Handle cases where the file does not exist.

# Test Strategy:
Test deleting files by ID and ensure both the file and metadata are removed. Verify that non-existent IDs return a 404 error.
